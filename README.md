## Objective 

Refractor existing code to meet website accessibility requirements and optimize for search engines. Clean up and improve the efficiency of CSS and HTML files, and ensure functionality by doing the following: 

* Use semantic elements
* Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Include accessible alt attributes in images
* Inlcude comments before each section
* The heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Inlcude concise, descriptive title element
* Consolidate and clean up CSS selectors
* Ensure all links are functioning properly

## Work Done HTML

- Changed title to "Horiseon's website detailing online marketing strategies"

- Cleaned up HTML formatting with proper spacing, consolidating unecessary div tags and using more efficient class names. I recall at least one extra "</img>" tag that didn't belong and was moved.

- Added descriptive comments for the different sections

- Added descriptive alt attributes to the images

- Modified the page footer


## Work Done CSS

*
The CSS file didn't need much modifying to the code itself to be functional, but it was heavily bloated and disorganized. This took a lot of time and research to clean up while retaining functionality. In the process I took the liberty of enhancing the stylesheet with various effets to improve the look of the website, but mainly just to practice more advanced css elements for my own development.  *

- Simplified all the redundant element and class rules into one for each group that shared the same attributes

- Organized rules to follow cascading priority rules in the order of Element rules first, class selector rules, and id selector rules.
